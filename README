st - simple terminal
--------------------
This is a fork by Axel Svensson of st, a simple terminal emulator for X.
For the upstream version, see https://st.suckless.org


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.

On debian:

    apt-get -qy install libxft-dev libxft2


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Build and install st (if necessary as root):

    make clean install

You may want to add st to alternatives, and select it:

    update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator x-terminal-emulator /usr/local/bin/st 50
    update-alternatives --set x-terminal-emulator /usr/local/bin/st

If the Delete key does not work in e.g. bash, fix it:

    echo set enable-keypad on > /etc/inputrc


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
